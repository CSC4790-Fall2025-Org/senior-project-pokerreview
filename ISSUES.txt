NOTES WHILE PLAYING:


3rd player joins in middle of hand, gets 2 cards face down. 
after hand ends, 3rd player does not get dealt in on the next hand. 
after showdown (check check) river, it requires a 3rd check for whatever reason. 
leave table mid hand, never terminates or moves on, should be treated as a fold.





Maybe scroll wheel for betting/raising instead of ^ down option

Delay after hand finishes “FINISHED” seems weird. Animation pushing chips to other player, stating who wins, show 5 card best hand

Should have the ability to click on the seat to choose ur seat. Not just randomized by “join as player” button

How to handle user getting stacked? No option to rebuy at same seat. Heads up, just ends.
