NOTES WHILE PLAYING:

all logic (BESIDES FOLDING) pre-flop works correctly


Maybe scroll wheel for betting/raising instead of ^ down option

Delay after hand finishes “FINISHED” seems weird. Animation pushing chips to other player, stating who wins, show 5 card best hand

Should have the ability to click on the seat to choose ur seat. Not just randomized by “join as player” button

How to handle user getting stacked? No option to rebuy at same seat. Heads up, just ends.

Leave table, doesn’t work. If I rejoin the table its as if I Never left.

Own modal for raise (don’t let opponents / your cards appear)
